School Dropout survey 
Problem statement number:117
Problem title: Student dropout analysis for education (Smart education software)
Project idea: We've created a website that collects information about the dropped out students from different parts of the country and helps the government to observe the dropout ratio of the places and take steps and make policies accordingly. The website will highlight the areas which needs to be dealt with more priority.
